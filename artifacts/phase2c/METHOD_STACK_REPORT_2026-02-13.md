# Method Stack Report (2026-02-13)

Scope: `FT-P2C-002`, `FT-P2C-004`, `FT-P2C-006`

## 1. alien-artifact-coding

- Decision-theoretic runtime contracts are encoded as mode-split policies (strict fail-closed vs hardened bounded fallback).
- Evidence ledger extensions now include dispatch key route decisions and scheduler telemetry.
- Formal safety/calibration claims are captured in packet contract tables and parity gates.

## 2. extreme-software-optimization

- Profile-first baseline retained via `ft-conformance` microbench report.
- One optimization lever per packet:
  - `FT-P2C-002`: keyset resolution path.
  - `FT-P2C-004`: dependency-driven ready-queue scheduler.
  - `FT-P2C-006`: canonical checkpoint hashing + deterministic sidecar generation.
- Behavior-isomorphism proof blocks: `artifacts/optimization/2026-02-13_phase2c_isomorphism.md`.

## 3. RaptorQ-everywhere durability

- Packet parity reports for `FT-P2C-002`, `FT-P2C-004`, and `FT-P2C-006` now have generated sidecars + decode proof artifacts.
- Sidecars and proofs are generated by `ft-serialize::generate_raptorq_sidecar` through `emit_packet_sidecar`.
- Decode proof hashes are deterministic and captured in packet decode-proof JSON artifacts.

## 4. frankenlibc/frankenfs security-compatibility doctrine

- Compatibility mode split is explicit and test-covered for dispatch, autograd scheduling, and serialization.
- Unknown incompatible features fail closed (unknown dispatch bits, unknown checkpoint fields, version/checksum mismatches).
- Compatibility matrix and drift gates updated in `FEATURE_PARITY.md` and packet parity gates.
